# SunFounder-Smart-Car-Reimagined

this is a little project that i did a while back when i had recieved the SunFounder Smart Video Car Kit as a present. I loved it
when i first got it but soon hated it shortly after. I did not enjoy the subpar program that SunFonder had created to control this
thing. With its Horrible TKinter gui system i was fed up and decided to do away with it all together.

Ive edited some of the original code to be able to use the SmartCar without WiFi and be able to control it using bluetooth
with a playstion3 controller.

This project requires you to run pygame to be able to use it with a controller.
